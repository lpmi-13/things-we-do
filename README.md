# Things we do

this is a compilation of things that happen in authentic
devops situations, and which could potentially ne used
as the source of a knowledge graph.

When possible, links to docs or examples are provided.

## Migrations

https://about.gitlab.com/blog/continuously-deploying-the-largest-gitlab-instance/

## Networking

debug a DNS issue in a multi-region cluster (could we do this via other network segmentation)

## containers 

analyze the trade-offs of using a Service Mesh (any learning materials would need to enable measuring things with and without said service mesh)

## Misc

deal with connection pools getting exhausted, weirdness in retry logic, and traffic patterns shifting in a way that happens maybe once a month.
